# Spoken Language Processing Resources

The following resources is a subset from [Awesome-Pytorch-list](https://github.com/bharathgs/Awesome-pytorch-list) which is specially focused on Spoken Language Processing (SLP).

## Pytorch

[pytorch](http://pytorch.org ) : Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration.
### Speech to Text (STT)
```
Speech to text is also called Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The goal to to convert a series of speech signal into text. 
```
1. [speech](https://github.com/awni/speech): PyTorch ASR Implementation.
2. [espnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet): End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit espnet.github.io/espnet
3. [deepspeech2](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch) : (Paper Implementation) Implementation of DeepSpeech2 using Baidu Warp-CTC. Creates a network based on the DeepSpeech2 architecture, trained with the CTC activation function.
### Text to Speech (TTS)
```
Text to Speech is also called Speech Sysnthesis. The goal is to generate speech based on text.
```
1. [loop](https://github.com/facebookresearch/loop): A method to generate speech across multiple speakers
2. [Tacotron-pytorch](https://github.com/soobinseo/Tacotron-pytorch): Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis.
3. [tacotron_pytorch](https://github.com/r9y9/tacotron_pytorch) : (Paper Implementation) PyTorch implementation of Tacotron speech synthesis model.
4. [TTS](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS): Deep learning for Text2Speech

### Speech Activity Detection (SAD)
```
The task of Speech Activity Detection including speaker diarization
```
1. [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio): Neural building blocks for speaker diarization: speech activity detection, speaker change detection, speaker embedding
